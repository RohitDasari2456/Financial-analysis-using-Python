Business risk represents external and internal factors that may lead a company to a reduction of profits or even bankruptcy.\nBelow are some of the types of business risk that exist in almost all companies:\n\n\n    \n1.Economic Risk: Economy is constantly changing and facing different trends. A company may suffer a hit on sales if the current status of the economy is recessionary.\n\n    \n2.Financial Risk: It is the risk associated with company customers not being able to repay its debts. Company own debt can be included in this category.\n\n    \n3.Legal Risk: A firm may face large penalties if it is not compliance with all regulations in countries where it operates.\n\n    \n4.Operational Risk: Companies can face disruptions in their day to day operations that may affect their bottom lines."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# How Companies Manage Business Risk?

Then assess the likelihood of such incidents to happen.\n\nA business risk management plan should be continuously reviewed and adapted to evolving changes in the company environment."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# How to Measure Business Risk?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "As analysts, we could directly measure business risk by using standard deviation on recent company financials. For instance, we could take company\u2019s financial indicators. Such as operating income, revenue or net income. Then, we could calculate the standard deviation of these metrics to analyse the variation in recent years.\n\nThe lower the standard deviation, the lower the variation. A lower variation means that a business have less uncertainty about future firm performance.\n\nAlthough using standard deviation would be the easiest option, it would not offer the best comparison across companies of different sizes. For example, a growing company will have a much larger yearly sales variation in comparison to most mature firm.\n\nWe will adjust for the size of the company to get rid of this comparability issue. This way we can represent the standard deviation of key metrics in a format enabling comparison across firms.\n\nTo standardise above mentioned business risk metrics and enable comparison across firms of different sizes, we can use the coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is computed by dividing standard deviation by the mean.\n\n\nBelow is an example on how can we calculate the coefficient of variation for sales:\n\nRevenues Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation Revenues / Revenues Mean\n\nBy using the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation, we can compare business risk across firms of different sizes.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Calculating Business Risk with Python"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To keep things simple, we will only calculate business risk based on sales, operating income and net income. And we will use the coefficient of variation for that purpose.\n\nWe will start with a list of 3 stocks, AAPL, MICROSOFT  and GOOGLE  . Then we will compare business risk across them. Feel free to add more companies to the analysis.\n\nFirst, we will use an API, financialmodelingprep. It offers around 200 free API calls per day upon registration. With this API, we can extract company revenues, operating income and net income for the last years.\n\nTo extract each company metrics, we simply pass the company ticker to the url as per below. Note that you need to store your API key into the demo variable.\n\nThen, we append the extracted values into a list.
